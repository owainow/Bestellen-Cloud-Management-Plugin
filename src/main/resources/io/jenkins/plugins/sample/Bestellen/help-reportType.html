A report is generated as a PDF and contains easy to read run data. The report is generated in the Jenkins home directory.
Report generation does support post run archiving as a post build action. Each report is saved in the job workspace under
either the latestReport directory or the previousReports directory. Archiving of the latest run will always work if
"latestReport/*" is entered into the Archive Artefact plugin.
